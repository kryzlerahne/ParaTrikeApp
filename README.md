<h1 align="center"> ParaTrike: A Mobile-Based Application for Tricycle Booking </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
<p align=justify> Covid-19 has taken the world by surprise over the last two years, and its global impact cannot be quantified. The Philippines is one of the nations that has been severely hit by the pandemic, which has aggravated one of the country's major concerns in the transportation sector, which is the limited accessibility of the Filipinos to various public transportation due to the operational capacity that must be followed prior to the risk of virus transmission. Millions of public transport drivers have been affected by the mass transportation shut down during the last quarters of the COVID lockdown. However, as the number of cases decreased, Balik Pasada permits were gradually issued to thousands of public transportation vehicle units, including tricycles, although with restrictions. Most people today have resumed working face-to-face and traveling, as the government of the Philippines has lifted its restrictions and reopened enterprises to rebuild the economy because most individuals have now been vaccinated. As a result, there is an increase in the demand for public transportation vehicles and a convenient routine of riding by the commuters to reach their various destinations. </p>

<p align=justify>  Considering this, commuting is very important not just for the means of transportation but also for the essential role it plays in the daily activities of the society due to the large percentage of the working population that goes to work daily, as this is less expensive and economical seeing as how people nowadays struggle because of the effect of the pandemic on their lives. The use of tricycles as the primary means of public transportation in large neighborhoods such as subdivisions and villages has gone mainstream within the population living within that area because of the long distance of most of the people to the terminal and their lack of contact. Prior to this practice, the researchers reached out to a certain organization of tricycle drivers to help them in which they have chosen, particularly Toda G5 in Lourdes terminal in Batangas, which is actually offering this kind of service. According to them, they are still attempting to re-establish their regular passengers and pre-pandemic routine. Most of the drivers also said that they were unable to reach as many passengers as they would have wished in order to earn more money, especially since their expenses are continuously increasing and because vehicles and commuters are too far off and having trouble connecting with one another. </p>

<p align=justify> Most commuters struggle as well, especially during rush hours when there is a low demand for tricycles or during off-peak hours when they have to walk far enough to reach the main terminal of the village just to catch a ride towards the main city. </p>

<h3> Purpose and Description </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>

<p align="jusify"> Para Trike is a mobile-based application that allows its end-users to easily book tricycles within their 500m radius. They would be able to book their ride depending on their chosen location and available driver during that time. Upon booking, the estimated time of arrival, fare price, mode of payment, and driverâ€™s information will then be displayed. Commuters are allowed to cancel their booking. </p>
