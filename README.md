<h1 align="center"> ParaTrike: A Mobile-Based Application for Tricycle Booking </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
<p align=justify> Covid-19 has taken the world by surprise over the last two years, and its global impact cannot be quantified. The Philippines is one of the nations that has been severely hit by the pandemic, which has aggravated one of the country's major concerns in the transportation sector, which is the limited accessibility of the Filipinos to various public transportation due to the operational capacity that must be followed prior to the risk of virus transmission. Millions of public transport drivers have been affected by the mass transportation shut down during the last quarters of the COVID lockdown. However, as the number of cases decreased, Balik Pasada permits were gradually issued to thousands of public transportation vehicle units, including tricycles, although with restrictions. Most people today have resumed working face-to-face and traveling, as the government of the Philippines has lifted its restrictions and reopened enterprises to rebuild the economy because most individuals have now been vaccinated. As a result, there is an increase in the demand for public transportation vehicles and a convenient routine of riding by the commuters to reach their various destinations. </p>

<p align=justify>  Considering this, commuting is very important not just for the means of transportation but also for the essential role it plays in the daily activities of the society due to the large percentage of the working population that goes to work daily, as this is less expensive and economical seeing as how people nowadays struggle because of the effect of the pandemic on their lives. The use of tricycles as the primary means of public transportation in large neighborhoods such as subdivisions and villages has gone mainstream within the population living within that area because of the long distance of most of the people to the terminal and their lack of contact. According to the drivers, they are still attempting to re-establish their regular passengers and pre-pandemic routine. Most of them also said that they were unable to reach as many passengers as they would have wished in order to earn more money, especially since their expenses are continuously increasing and because vehicles and commuters are too far off and having trouble connecting with one another. </p>

<p align=justify> Most commuters struggle as well, especially during rush hours when there is a low demand for tricycles or during off-peak hours when they have to walk far enough to reach the main terminal of the village just to catch a ride towards the main city. </p>

<h3> Purpose and Description </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>

<p align="justify"> ParaTrike is a mobile-based application that allows its end-users which are primarily passengers, to easily book tricycles within their 500m radius location. They would be able to book their ride depending on their chosen location and available driver during that time. Upon booking, the estimated time of arrival, fare price, mode of payment, and driver’s information will then be displayed. Commuters are also allowed to cancel their booking but will be including fees as a help for the drivers. This application will also help alleviate the above mentioned issues and establish a more efficient, accessible, and convenient mode of transportation. The use of traditional ones was just too impractical, uncertain, time-consuming, and not fuel-efficient, especially given our current circumstances in the Philippines. Its purpose is to devise an application that modernizes and improves the existing process for the reservation and booking of tricycles with an ease of use that requires only a single tap that also uses GPS technology for location tracking and mapping. </p>

<p align="justify"> Furthermore, this application will help passengers save a lot of time and energy without having to worry about waiting and how they will get a ride despite their distance and lack of contact with the drivers. Through its features, it can have the potential to significantly influence how they perceive commuting and consider it as a cost-effective solution to the community’s transportation demands, while having to increase the wages of the drivers as a return. This application also delivers data in real-time for the convenience of everyone, which will also store and save all this commuter reservation information in its respective databases in a system placed in the terminal and handled by an administrator for safety reasons as necessary.

<h3> Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>

<p align="justify"> The SDGs which this project aims to attain are Decent Work and Economic Growth, as well as to achieve Sustainable Cities and Communities. These SDGs are further described as follows: </p>

<h1 align="center"> 

<h3> Objective </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
  
<p align="justify"> The main objective of this study is to develop ParaTrike, a mobile-based application and innovative platform for faster booking of tricycles as a means of transportation in the community which will be created using the technology HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the utilization of Ionic and Angular Frameworks. This application will be utilized for an automated and modernized booking system for the passenger's end. </p>

<h1 align="center"> 

<h3> Significance of the Project </h3> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
  
<p align="justify"> <strong>Community</strong> - This application benefits the community by improving the traditional method of booking rides in the area. A more efficient and modernized way will be used by the community and its people for their bookings, allowing for a more secure and safe travel experience. </p>

<p align="justify"> <strong>Passengers</strong> - The outcome of the project would provide passengers especially people who regularly rides tricycles for transportation, an easy way to find and book tricycles to bring them to their destination. The app also provides flexibility and security to passengers as it provides various payment methods and provides them with the tricycle driver's personal information. Those people whose primary method of transportation is commuting, and riding tricycles will also benefit from ParaTrike, making it much more accessible for them to reach the main road. This will allow them to remotely book and reserve tricycles in the terminal, without having to walk far, saving them time and energy in booking their rides stress-free. </p>
